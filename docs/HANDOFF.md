# Handoff

Read this first; rewrite it last (CLAUDE.md, "Sessions are independent"). It holds only what isn't in ROADMAP.md or the tickets.

**Updated:** 2026-10-22, by the session that built M09 and marked it done.

## Where things stand
- **M08, Comments and reactions, is done** (PRs #39, #40, #41 and #43; ticket `docs/milestones/M08-comments-and-reactions.md`). Its branch `m08-comments-and-reactions` is deleted, as CLAUDE.md says once a milestone is merged. The reviewers' deferred items are in ROADMAP "Next revision", From M08.
- **M09, Points and friends leaderboard, is done** (PRs #45 and #46; ticket `docs/milestones/M09-points-and-leaderboard.md`). Every finished run is scored into `private.points_ledger` (the ladder plus the rarity bonus) once its day closes, when a leaderboard first shows its player; the home page has the friends leaderboard. Its branch `m09-points-and-leaderboard` is deleted. The reviewers' deferred items are in ROADMAP "Next revision", From M09.
- **No milestone branch is open for M10.**
- PR #42 (`m16-game-2`, "M16: draft game 2 ticket") is open from another session; this one didn't touch it.

## Waiting on the human
- **M12:** whether usernames can change, and how often (Claude suggested once a month).
- **Before plor.app gets M07 and M08** (`db push`, M15 or when the human wants):
  - turn "Allow public access" off in the hosted project's Realtime settings (M07 D5);
  - check that `[[:alpha:]]` behaves the same there for display names (M07 7a, *unverified*).
- **The live board shows which question caught a friend** before you've finished, through "on question 3" then "finished", though never the answer. It's in the approved design; ROADMAP "Next revision" has it for the human.
- **Before approving the later drafted days,** note:
  - three repeat 2026-10-22's categories: car brand (11-06), state capitals (11-10) and tea (11-16);
  - several had a host swapped under the host-name rule (M06 ticket, Evidence).
- **Superpowers:** the human asked about the plugin. Its install card was shown in chat; whether it was installed is unknown.

## Next step
M10, Groups (ROADMAP), has no ticket yet, so draft one from `docs/milestones/_TEMPLATE.md` for the human on a new branch. ROADMAP "Next revision" has the deferred M08 and M09 items; one (the shared viewer-and-friends query) fits M10.

## Local state
- The local Supabase stack is running, Realtime included, and holds:
  - every migration up to `20261022105344_points_ledger.sql`;
  - `jasonex64` as an admin, who hasn't played 2026-10-22 locally (8b's checks didn't use that account);
  - the approved 2026-10-22 day.
- No dev server is left running.
- `npm run test:e2e` needs that stack running and `.env.local` pointing at it; Playwright starts the dev server. Chromium is installed with `npx playwright install chromium`. Right after `npm run build` the first e2e run can time out on a slow dev compile (ROADMAP, From M08).
- The dev server only serves `localhost:3000`; `127.0.0.1:3000` stays on "Loading…" (Next.js blocks other dev origins).
- To run it on another machine:
  1. `npm ci`, then `npx supabase start`, then `npx supabase migration up`, then `npm run dev`.
  2. Sign in with a code from Mailpit at `http://127.0.0.1:54324`.
  3. To make an account an admin, a session inserts its user ID into `private.admin` locally.
